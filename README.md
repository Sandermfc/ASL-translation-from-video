# ASL-translation-from-video
Translates, from a video, the ASL digits from 0-9 with an approximate accuracy of 70%

This project was done for the INFO4024 computer vision class over the course of 3 months.

Future plans include:
	- Being able to detect characters using SIFT/SURF and an SVM model trained on each sign.
	- Being able to detect words:
		* Detect both hands at the same time.
		* Detect a larger array of signs.
		* Detect emotion from facial expression using machine learning.
	- Porting the project to a smartphone platform.
	- Optimizations to make it run smoothly (realtime) on a smartphone
	- OR send raw video to a server which will analyze the data. (in which case, minimize the ammount of data being sent).
